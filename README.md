# Stream-Town-Public
This is the public repo of Stream Town


Please note that the third party library A* Pathfinding project has been removed from the repo as it is a paid asset on the unity store.
The game will not run without work, as this library is required for a lot of scripts.

Installing A* Pathfinding Project will fix this issue, or, feel free to implement your own pathfinding solution and fix any errors.
