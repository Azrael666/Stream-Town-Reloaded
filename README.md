# Stream Town: Reloaded
This is a community fork of Stream Town by Panda Belly. It seeks to expand upon the vision of the project under the newly allowed open source permissions of the original.

Note that the original code was a student project and that some things may not be to an industry standard while migration and upgrading are taking place.

Note that for testing purposes, you will need to register a Twitch bot application, and populate your Assets/StreamingAssets/twitch_secrets.json file with the access data for the bots.
DO NOT PUSH THIS FILE TO THE REPO! YOU WILL BE GIVING THE INTERNET ACCESS TO YOUR TWITCH ACCOUNT! If this should happen, IMMEDIATELY remove the file and regenerate your bot's credentials on Twitch.

You can find the original repo, and documents related to its creation, here:
